Android Car Dashboard

This Android application is a car dashboard developed for the student club AERO (Alternative Energy Racing Organization) at the University of Vermont.

The dashboard contains a GPS speedometer, can take selfies of the driver at certain preset speeds, and records max speeds and distance traveled.
